This repository demonstrates a common SQL error related to comparing NULL values. The `bug.sql` file contains a query that incorrectly attempts to find rows where a column is NULL using the '=' operator. The `bugSolution.sql` file shows the correct way to handle NULL comparisons using the `IS NULL` operator.
