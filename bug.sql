In SQL, a common error arises when handling NULL values.  Consider a query with a WHERE clause comparing a column to a NULL value using the '=' operator. This will always return an empty result set, even if NULL values exist in the column.  This happens because NULL represents the absence of a value, and comparing it to anything, even another NULL, results in an unknown state, not a true or false.
